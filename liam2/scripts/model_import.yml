# DELETE ALL "*.h5" FILES and EDIT "*.yml" FILES to correspond to model being run before importing anything in Notepad++.
#
# Programmable parameters currently set to (indicated by "==>") and alternative options (indicated by "<alt>"):
#
#  <alt>   Intervention "group" or "run" (local configuration constant INTERVENTION): False (no intervention).
#  ==>     Intervention "group" or "run" (local configuration constant INTERVENTION): True (single intervention which halves all-cause mortality rate).

# Run from "C_drive/LIAM2Suite_0.11.0-win64".
# Invoke editor as "editor/Notepad++Portable.exe".
# Load this file as "Level_01/model_import.yml".
#
# File/directory names in file are relative to the directory containing this file, thus relative to "[BUNDLEPATH]/Level_01", not to "[BUNDLEPATH]".
#
# This is a LIAM2 import file.  To use it, press F5 if using the editor bundled with LIAM2, otherwise run following command in a console:
# C:\Users\bobgian\LIAM2Suite_0.11.0-win64\liam2\main.exe import C:\Users\bobgian\LIAM2Suite_0.11.0-win64\Level_01\model_import.yml
#
# Note that local variables which are set in the code below to conditionalize a run are written in UPPERCASE to make them easier to find.
# Local variables computed in a function (NOT edited to conditionalize a run) are in Mixed_Case.
# Globals are also UPPERCASE (by convention).  So are macros (though none are used in this program).
